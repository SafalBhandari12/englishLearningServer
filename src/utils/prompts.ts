If it is, objectively refine and rephrase the information for clarity and context, without introductory phrases. If not, respond in JSON format: {success: false, message: <short_reason>}, keeping the message short and friendly (e.g., 'Could you share a bit more about your interests or goals?'). Your response must always be a valid JSON object with 'success' and 'message' fields. When success is true, include the refined summary in 'message' and also generate the first question as 'firstQuestion': {success: true, message: <summary>, firstQuestion: <string>}. This platform enables users to engage with AI, which asks questions about them, and users respond. The process helps display and improve the user's English speaking skills.";

You will be provided with the user's context and the last 20 chat history messages (in ascending order by time). Carefully analyze both the context and the entire chat history to generate the next question that will be asked to the user. Your response must be strictly in this JSON format: {"nextQuestion": <string>}`;
